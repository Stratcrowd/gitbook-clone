Build a production-ready GitBook-style Knowledge Base web app for “Thinking Robot”.

Goal:

A public docs website similar to GitBook: left sidebar navigation with expandable categories + nested pages, breadcrumbs, previous/next navigation, and full-text search.

An admin panel where I (admin) can create/edit docs, categories, and nested hierarchies.

Content should support headings (H1/H2/H3), code blocks, tables, images, callouts, and links.

I should be able to import articles quickly (manual import is fine to start; Google Docs/Notion sync can be Phase 2).

Reference structure (like this):

Home page shows tiles/cards for collections (e.g., Projects, PICO BOT, PCB Manufacturing, etc.)

Inside a collection: categories + nested pages, like:

Projects

IOT Projects

Smart Plant Monitoring…

PICO BOT

Beginners Guide and Assembly

Control on WiFi using ESP32

Autonomous using Arduino

PCB Designing and Manufacturing

Manufacture PCB at home

Intro to PCBs and how it’s made

Tech Requirements:

Framework: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript.

Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui.

Database: Supabase Postgres (or Postgres + Prisma). Use Prisma ORM.

Auth: NextAuth (credentials login) with roles (admin/user). Only admin can edit content.

Deployment: Vercel-ready (env vars, build scripts).

Content rendering: Markdown/MDX rendering with syntax highlighting.

Editor: Admin editor should support Markdown + image upload. If possible, use a rich editor (Tiptap) but store as Markdown/HTML consistently.

Core Features (Public):

Home page:

Shows “Collections” as cards (title, description, icon).

Collection page:

Left sidebar with categories and nested pages (tree).

Main reading view with:

title

optional description

table of contents (auto from headings)

previous/next navigation

Search:

Search box in header; searches titles + body content.

Results page with highlighted snippets.

SEO:

Clean URLs: /{collectionSlug}/{pageSlug} with nesting handled.

OpenGraph tags and proper metadata.

Core Features (Admin):

/admin dashboard (protected):

CRUD for Collections, Categories, Pages.

Hierarchy builder:

Pages can have parentId to create nested structure.

Ability to reorder items (drag & drop if possible; otherwise up/down buttons).

Import tools (Phase 1):

“Paste Markdown” → creates a new page under selected category/parent.

“Upload images” → stored in Supabase Storage (or local during dev).

Bulk import (Phase 1 simple):

Accept a ZIP with Markdown files and a JSON map describing hierarchy OR accept a single Markdown and auto-create headings as subpages (optional).

Phase 2 (optional scaffolding only, do not block MVP):

Google Docs import: user pastes a Google Doc link and the app imports exported HTML/Docx (no OAuth in MVP).

Notion sync: manual only (export markdown) in MVP; later API sync.

Database Models (suggested):

User(id, email, passwordHash, role)

Collection(id, title, slug, description, icon)

Category(id, collectionId, title, slug, order)

Page(id, collectionId, categoryId, parentId nullable, title, slug, content, contentType, order, published, createdAt, updatedAt)

PageSearchIndex (optional for faster search)

Acceptance Criteria:

I can deploy on Vercel with Supabase env vars.

Public site works: browse by sidebar, open pages, see TOC, prev/next.

Admin can login and create a collection/category/page, reorder hierarchy, paste markdown, upload images.

Search works across pages.

No credentials hardcoded; everything via env vars.

Deliver:

Full codebase with clear README: setup, env vars, Supabase schema migration, deploy steps.
